CodeBook

This is a code book that describes the transformations performed to clean up the data.

The script run_analysis.R implements the 5 steps requested in the course project's definition by implementing the following:

    1. Data in train and test datasets is merged using rbind()
    2. The columns in the dataset are filtered with grep to keep only the columns with avg and std data
    3. Merge and set names for activity dataset by using merge() over activity_labels dataset
    4. Merge and name subject datasets. Use gsub() to rename the columns in the values dataset with descriptive names.
    5. Merges the subject, activity and values datasets. Creates new dataset by calculating the average for each value column grouped by subject and activity. To prevent problems with non-numeric values, the original activity values is used and then replaced again as in step 3. Then columns are reordered and rearranged so the activity and subject are the first ones and then the values. 
	
The results generated by the run_analysis.R are in the file final.txt
