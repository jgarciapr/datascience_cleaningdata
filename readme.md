Course Project

The script run_analysis.R, as requested in the course project, is intended to do the following over the given dataset:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to use the run_analysis.R script:

    1. Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive.
    2. Change line4 of the script to point to your local folder where the dataset and the script are located.
    3. Run the script and get the results from the file final.txt
